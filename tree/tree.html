  Just in case of the "hit by a bus" scenario, here's everything I've just
  learned about b-trees and how it should tie in to NTFS.

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
  B+Trees 
  </p>

  fixed order
  height balanced
  during add/remove of keys
  minimal disturbance
  pointers downwards only

  <h3>NTFS Trees</h3>

      index root
      index allocation
      dummy keys
      data in non-leaf keys
      on-disk pointer only point down

  What we have so far

      ...

  Overview

      ...

  Add Rules

      Find the first key that is larger than the new key
      (this will be a necessarily be a leaf)
      Insert the new key before this key (in the same node)
      While the node is full
	  Split the current node in two
	  Promote the median key to the parent
	  Now consider the parent
      End
    
  Delete Rules

      Delete the key
      If the key had children
	  Find the successor and move it to this node
	  Now consider the successor's old node
      End
      While the node isn't full enough
	  If a sibling has enough keys
	    steal one
	  Else
	    Combine with one of the sibling
	  End
      End

  flatcap	hi _Oracle_
  _Oracle_	hi there
  flatcap	anything I can do for you?
  _Oracle_	I was wondering about the B+ trees of ntfs
  _Oracle_	they seem to be a bit awkward, or at least - not what I expected :)
  flatcap	they _do_ seem strange, but they are perfect for filesystems
  _Oracle_	no, i meant their on-disk representation
  _Oracle_	they have a dummy node of sorts?
  flatcap	the trees in ntfs aren't proper b+trees
  flatcap	a dummy key
  _Oracle_	that's exactly what I was hoping to hear!
  flatcap	(thinking is still a bit hard this morning, bear with me :-)
  _Oracle_	no problem ;-)
  flatcap	the trees consist of a node, which contains keys
  flatcap	the keys in a real (ideal world) b+tree are just separators, and the data is only stored in the leaves
  _Oracle_	right
  _Oracle_	btw - how big is a node under ntfs? i mean, how many keys fit in there?
  flatcap	the INDX record is 4k, an you can get 10's of filenames in it
  flatcap	but..., that depends on the lengths of the filenames
  _Oracle_	i thought the number of keys in a node was a fixed property of a b+ tree?
  flatcap	hehe, usually, yes
  flatcap	the keys of ntfs actually contain data and also a pointer to their children
  _Oracle_	so i noticed
  AntonA	one should add that INDX records of 2k size have also been seen in the wild -- by me (-:
  _Oracle_	really? 
  _Oracle_	what OS?
  AntonA	NT4
  flatcap	because there's one more child than key, there has to be a dummy key (no data, but has children)
  _Oracle_	interesting...
  AntonA	some of my directories (e.g. c:\winnt and c:\program files) have 2k INDX size while other dirs have 4k.
  _Oracle_	so the dummy key is always the "largest"?
  flatcap	yes
  _Oracle_	i see...
  _Oracle_	so if the non-leaf nodes have data of themselves, wouldn't that make the tree a b-tree?
  flatcap	I've just written a test program to help me understand the trees, which is on bitkeeper
  _Oracle_	I'd love to see that
  flatcap	I read a lots of webpages and I think that the nearest term is a b*tree
  _Oracle_	and how is it different from a b-tree?
  flatcap	a b-tree maintains a minimum of 1/2 full nodes (except for the root node)
  flatcap	a b*tree changes the rules slightly and maintains 2/3 full
  _Oracle_	so it just changes the rules of combining two nodes to one and such?
  flatcap	exactly
  _Oracle_	hmmm...
  _Oracle_	let me think about that for a moment :)
  flatcap	in a true b+tree, the data keys (leaves) should also have pointers to the next (for quick sequential accesses), but that's probably just maintained in memory
  flatcap	I'm going to write up everything I know about ntfs trees soon
  _Oracle_	let me see if i got that...
  _Oracle_	the index root points to the root INDX record
  flatcap	you can see my test prog at:  http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net:8080/tng-support/src/tree
  _Oracle_	each INDX record contains keys that have pointers to the files themselves and to the keys with lower values
  flatcap	yes
  _Oracle_	I see
  flatcap	the index root lives in the MFT record
  _Oracle_	Yeah, this I managed to discover :)
  flatcap	all the rest (index allocations) are non-res
  _Oracle_	and the number of keys in a single INDX record is completely flexible?
  AntonA	yes
  flatcap	yes, but there's a minimum
  AntonA	a minimum?
  flatcap	yes, that's part of the tree algorithm
  AntonA	surely the minimum is a non-data containing terminator entry?
  _Oracle_	what's the minimum?
  flatcap	the minimum for a b+tree is 1/2 full, b* 2/3 full
  flatcap	only the root node may contain fewer
  _Oracle_	oh.
  _Oracle_	yeah
  AntonA	and the last node...
  flatcap	the keys are moved about to keep this true
  flatcap	even the last node will have the "right number" in it
  AntonA	that would mean that in a really large directory deleting one file could take hours?
  flatcap	no, you might think that, but the balancing doesn't affect many other nodes
  flatcap	if the tree is 4 deep (NTFS equiv say 10^5 files), you'd only be altering 4 index records
  flatcap	I'll draw lots of pictures when I have a moment (probably tomorrow)
  _Oracle_	that should be interesting to read!
  flatcap	are you on our dev mailing list, _Oracle_
  _Oracle_	What mailing list? (er... no.)
  AntonA	the major question that springs to my mind is what would windows ntfs do if it saw an imbalanced tree (because we messed up or because we simply chose to ignore balancing)
  flatcap	hehe, I hate to think :-)
  _Oracle_	I wouldn't want to be there, that's for sure
  flatcap	chkdsk would probably try and rebalance it and you might find that ntfs.sys would just balance it out as files were created/deleted
  _Oracle_	how do i join the list?
  flatcap	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-ntfs-dev
  AntonA	um, it would be a lot easier to get directory operations working while ignoring the existence of the tree (obviously operating on them correctly so we don't kill the fs)
  flatcap	I'll mail the list and answer questions there
  AntonA	if windows is able to pickup the pieces without complaint / failure, it would be worth considering as a first pass of implementation at least.
  flatcap	yes possibly, but I think I know enough now to build something close enough
  flatcap	(I just wanted a big project where I could start without tripping over you :-)
  AntonA	cool
  _Oracle_	I've got a few more questions if you have the time
  AntonA	As I said before. I am not going anywhere near directories. (-:
  flatcap	sure
  _Oracle_	Smaller ones, though

  <p>
  This is a set of examples covering all the mechanisms for a B+Tree.  There are
  other combinations which are the mirror images of some of the examples.
  </p>

  <p>
  All the examples have nodes with order 4, i.e a maximum of 4 keys.  With
  higher orders, some other manipulations will be necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
  In each of the examples, a node (cyan) contains one or more keys (white,
  named).  Each node is terminated with a dummy key (exclamation mark) which is
  lexicographically higher in any comparisons with normal key names.
  </p>
