  <h3>Deleting</h3>

  <p>
  For the deletion examples we'll start very simply then get complicated very
  fast.  One large example shows all the ways in which delete affects the tree.
  </p>

  <a name="del01"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 1</div>
  <img src="del/01.png"><br>
  <p>
  Starting with a simple node, we delete <q>E</q>.
  </p>

  <a name="del02"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 2</div>
  <img src="del/02.png"><br>
  <p>
  Then we delete <q>A</q>.
  </p>

  <a name="del03"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 3</div>
  <img src="del/03.png"><br>
  <p>
  This leaves us with an empty node.
  </p>

  <a name="del04"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 4</div>
  <img src="del/04.png"><br>
  <p>
  Now we start with a large example tree.  We want to delete <q>G</q>.  It's
  got children, so we find the successor <q>J</q>, delete <q>G</q> and put
  <q>J</q> in its place.  If the key doesn't have any children, this this stage
  can be skipped.
  </p>

  <a name="del05"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 5</div>
  <img src="del/05.png"><br>
  <p>
  Now we have transformed the problem into a leaf being deleted.  Unfortunately
  this leaves us with a deficient node <q>!</q>.  Our siblings don't have any
  keys we can steal to make up our numbers, so to fix this, we will have to
  combine with a sibling.
  </p>

  <a name="del06"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 6</div>
  <img src="del/06.png"><br>
  <p>
  We have demoted <q>K</q> and adopted <q>O</q> from our right-hand sibling.
  Unfortunately that leaves us with a deficient node <q>!</q>, so we work on
  that node next.  This time we have a sibling with a key we can steal.  To keep
  the tree in order, we will promote <q>E</q> and demote <q>J</q>.
  </p>

  <a name="del07"></a>
  <div class="figure">Figure 7</div>
  <img src="del/07.png"><br>
  <p>
  If you look closely, you will see that one of the nodes (containing <q>F</q>)
  has swapped sides of the tree.  Because the pointers on-disk only point
  downwards, the the <q>F</q> node isn't changed.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once a steal has occurred, the operation is complete.
